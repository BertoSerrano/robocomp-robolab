Download and install MIT's C++ port of E. Olson's AprilTags, [at](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/)

1. First we need to install *libv4l-dev* and eigen3 from the Ubuntu repositories

    sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev libeigen3-dev

2. Now checkout AprilTags code from subversion to your favourite software directory:
    
    svn co https://svn.csail.mit.edu/apriltags

3. cd apriltags 

4. make  (don't run cmake)
    
If it does not finish due to OpenCV error its OK as long as libapriltags.a is generated.

5. Copy .h and library to /usr/local
    
    sudo cp -r pod-build/include/* /usr/local/include
    sudo cp -r pod-build/lib/libapriltags.a /usr/local/lib
